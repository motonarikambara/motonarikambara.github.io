      <description>Case Relation Transformer: A Crossmodal Language Generation Model for Fetching Instructions There have been many studies in robotics to improve the communication skills of domestic service robots. Most studies, however, have not fully benefited from recent advances in deep neural networks because the training datasets are not large enough. In this paper, our aim is crossmodal language generation.&#xA;We propose the Case Relation Transformer (CRT), which generates a fetching instruction sentence from an image, such as â€œMove the blue flip-flop to the lower left box.</description>

      <description>Relational Future Captioning Model for Explaining Likely Collisions in Daily Tasks Domestic service robots that support daily tasks are a promising solution for elderly or disabled people. It is crucial for domestic service robots to explain the collision risk before they perform actions.&#xA;In this paper, our aim is to generate a caption about a future event. We propose the Relational Future Captioning Model (RFCM), a crossmodal language generation model for the future captioning task.</description>
